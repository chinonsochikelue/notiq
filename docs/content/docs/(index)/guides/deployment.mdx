# Deployment

## Deploying the Documentation

The Notiq documentation is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/). It is optimized for deployment on Vercel but can be hosted on any platform that supports Next.js.

### Vercel (Recommended)
The easiest way to deploy is using the Vercel integration.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect the repository to Vercel.
3. Add the required environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI key (starting with `sk-`).
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: The production URL of your docs.

### Build Command
If you are deploying elsewhere:
```bash
pnpm build
```
This will generate a production-ready `.next` folder.

## Deploying the Editor (Library)

If you are using Notiq as a library in your own app, follow these steps for production safety:

### 1. Bundle Optimization
Notiq uses dynamic imports for heavy plugins (Excalidraw, Figma). Ensure your bundler (webpack/vite) is configured for code splitting.

### 2. Style Injection
Make sure to import the Notiq styles in your main entry point:
```tsx
import "@collabchron/notiq/styles.css";
```

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Notiq is a **client-side library**. If you use it in a Next.js app, ensure you import the `Editor` component using `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`:

```tsx
const Editor = dynamic(() => import("@collabchron/notiq"), { ssr: false });
```

## CI/CD Tips
- **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint` before every deploy.
- **Type Checking**: Run `tsc --noEmit` to ensure type safety in production.
