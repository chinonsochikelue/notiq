# Interactive Components

Notiq goes beyond simple text by providing powerful interactive blocks. Each of these is implemented as a custom Lexical node and a corresponding plugin.

## Excalidraw (Whiteboard)

The Excalidraw block allows you to embed full-featured whiteboards directly into your documents.

### How it Works
When you insert an Excalidraw block, Notiq opens a modal containing the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) editor. Once you save, the drawing is serialized into a JSON string and stored within an `ExcalidrawNode`.

- **Command**: `INSERT_EXCALIDRAW_COMMAND`
- **Data Persistence**: Stores `elements`, `appState`, and `files` as a JSON blob.
- **Rendering**: Uses a non-editable preview in the editor and can be edited by clicking the block.

## Math & Equations (KaTeX)

Notiq supports complex mathematical notation using the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) library.

### Usage
- **Inline Math**: Wraps math in a single line.
- **Block Math**: Centers the equation on its own line.

### Technical Details
- **Command**: `INSERT_EQUATION_COMMAND`
- **Payload**: `{ equation: string, inline: boolean }`
- **Styling**: Uses the official KaTeX CSS, imported via `@import 'katex/dist/katex.css'`.

## Figma & Embeds

Notiq provides a flexible embedding system for third-party platforms.

### Figma
Embed live Figma prototypes or files by providing the URL. The `FigmaPlugin` handles the transformation of a URL into an `<iframe>` wrapped in a custom node.

### YouTube & Twitter
Similar to Figma, these plugins listen for `PASTE_COMMAND` or use a dedicated insertion command to create responsive embeds.

## Best Practices
- **Large Drawings**: Since Excalidraw data is stored within the document, extremely large drawings might increase document size.
- **AI Context**: Notiq's AI Writing Assistant can "see" the text content around these blocks but currently cannot analyze the drawings or complex math equations.
